# Odin Project – Node.js Backend Journey

This repository documents my learning and projects from **The Odin Project’s Node.js Backend path**.
The goal is to build a solid foundation in backend development using **JavaScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs**, while preparing for real-world full-stack development.

👉 Would you like me to make this README more **personalized** (like adding your PostgreSQL practice, or linking your GitHub profile & Odin Project curriculum), so recruiters see your real journey?
